# Java Spring PWR 2017 Course Page
# Intro
This is the homepage of Java/Spring course organized on Wrocław Uniwersity of Technology by [PGS Software](https://www.pgs-soft.com/) in Spring 2017.

Our goal is to go through key aspects of professional development of web application based on the most popular Java web framework - [Spring]( https://spring.io/).

After the course, we would like to invite some of you to participate in summer internship program at PGS Software. Do not worry, its paid internship, and you will be able to put your newly acquired knowledge in practice in real-world challenges in renowned software house. Perhaps later you would like to stay with us longer…

## Project Setup
### In Eclipse:
* File -> Import -> Maven-> Existing Maven Projects -> Next
* Select WeatherForecast as root directory. You should have root pom.xml file displayed and submodules pom.xml underneath. -> Finish.
* Wait for Importing Maven projects background job to finish
* Go to Workbench (upper right corner)
* If there will be Java problems don’t panic
* Window -> preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs -> Add -> Standard VM -> Directory for Java JDK (not JRE!) -> Finish. Choose jdk from list -> Apply.
* Root project (WeatherForecast) -> Run as Maven Install, it should output “[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS” at the end
* If there are still red markers: Project -> Clean
* Go to com.pgs.ws.rest.Application.java class in rest module, Run as -> Java Application
* Output should start to appear on console, and at the end, you should get a line like:  “ : Started Application in 12.208 seconds (JVM running for 12.852)”

### In MySQL Workbench (setup for chapter 5: Database)
* MySQL Connections -> Local instance MySQL57
* File -> New query tab
* Create schema by executing statement: “CREATE DATABASE forecast DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;”
* Schema name should match property: “spring.datasource.url”  in project file: “WeatherForecast\database-access\src\main\resources\application.properties”, in this case “jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/forecast”
* Create user by executing statement: “CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY userpass;”
* User name and password should match properties “spring.datasource.username” and “spring.datasource.password” in the same file
* Grant the new user permissions to schema: “GRANT ALL ON forecast.* TO 'username'@'localhost';”
* Click refresh in Schemas and select forecast if it’s not visible yet
* File -> Run SQL script, select script from project: “WeatherForecast\database-access\src\main\resources\sql\mysql\ddl\V0__create_forecast_table.sql”, select forecast schema -> Run

## Curl

* Download curl from https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
* From command line: curl -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/forecast/Berlin/
* It should output something like: {"location":"Berlin","temperature":278}

## Postman

* Postman might be more convenient alternative to curl, download and install from https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction (requires Google Chrome browser)
* In New tab -> Enrer request URL: “http://localhost:8080/forecast/Berlin/2016-03-03/” 
* In headers select “Content-type” key and “application/json”
* Hit send, and you should get the same output as in Curl
